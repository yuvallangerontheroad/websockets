``websockets`` provides complete client and server implementations, as shown
in the :doc:`getting started guide <../intro>`.

The process for opening and closing a WebSocket connection depends on which
side you're implementing.

* On the client side, connecting to a server with :class:`~websockets.connect`
  yields a connection object that provides methods for interacting with the
  connection. Your code can open a connection, then send or receive messages.

  If you use :class:`~websockets.connect` as an asynchronous context manager,
  then websockets closes the connection on exit. If not, then your code is
  responsible for closing the connection.

* On the server side, :class:`~websockets.serve` starts listening for client
  connections and yields an server object that supports closing the server.

  Then, when clients connects, the server initializes a connection object and
  passes it to a handler coroutine, which is where your code can send or
  receive messages. This pattern is called `inversion of control`_. It's
  common in frameworks implementing servers.

  When the handler coroutine terminates, websockets closes the connection. You
  may also close it in the handler coroutine if you'd like.

Once the connection is open, the WebSocket protocol is symmetrical, except for
low-level details that websockets manages under the hood. The same methods are
available on client connections created with :class:`~websockets.connect` and
on server connections passed to the connection handler in the arguments.

At this point, websockets provides the same API — and uses the same code — for
client and server connections. For convenience, common methods are documented
both in the client API and server API.

All public APIs can be imported from the :mod:`websockets` package, unless
noted otherwise. Anything that isn't listed in this API documentation is a
private API, with no guarantees of behavior or backwards-compatibility.
